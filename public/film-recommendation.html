<h1>The Best 35mm Film (I Shot and Reviewed 12+ Rolls)</h1>
<p>
 Selecting the best 35mm film for your needs is a daunting task. We usually just pick one and go. I purchased and shot 13 (and counting) rolls of film and published the images to help you pick the best film stock for you.

<p>For me, shooting film has always been an important release from the time-pressured world of digital photography. These days it seems we have to constantly be on, shooting, downloading, editing, sharing, liking, and subscribing. Film photography takes most of that away and leaves you alone with your best film camera to focus on taking photos. But, how do you choose the best 35mm film for what you’re planning on shooting?
</p>
<p>
    I was looking online and couldn’t find any other real comparisons, where someone had actually gone and shot each roll of film in a similar environment to compare the film stocks. They were all compilation lists from Flickr images. So I went on Amazon, spent hundreds of pounds, and initially purchased 12 different rolls of film (I have more on the way now).

<h2>The Three Main Types of Film</h2>
<p>
    There are three main types of film. Within each type of film there are further differences in the speed, aesthetic (think Instagram filters), and also in how each type of film is developed. The main “branches” of the film are as below:
</p>

<h3>Color Negative Film</h3>
<p>
    This film is what you’re probably most familiar with, and it’s also the most easily available today. When you take a photo with color negative film, you’ll see the image in inverted colors. Most photography centers can develop color-negative (C-41) prints for you at a reasonable cost.
</p>
<h3>Black and White Film</h3>
<p>
    If you just love shooting black and white photos, you’ll be pleased to hear that black and white film isn’t expensive and it’s easy to get hold of. Furthermore, you can very easily develop black and white film at home. See also our article on How To Develop Film at Home here.
</p>
<h3>Slide Film</h3>
<p>
    Without a doubt, slide film is the most expensive type of film around. You probably don’t want to start here. The advantage of using slide film is that you will see the image you captured just like a normal photograph. Slide film can sometimes be harder to get your hands on, and not all photography shops and centers can develop this film.
